**Output from dual RNA-seq Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) studying stage specific expression of Fusarium graminearum infection of wheat**

**Fgram_Module_annotation** 

This includes comma separated value (CSV) files for all genes in each module for both fungal and wheat modules, which are annotated with Module Membership (MM) values, mean FPKM values, 
InterPro annotation and Gene Ontology annotation across stages of infection. 

**Wheat_Module_Annotation** 

This includes comma separated value (CSV) files for all genes in each module for both fungal and wheat modules, which are annotated with Module Membership (MM) values, mean FPKM values, 
InterPro annotation, Plant Trait Ontology (TO) and Gene Ontology annotation across stages of infection. 

**Module_Eigengene** 
The function multiSetMEs from the WGCNA package (Langfelder et al., 2007) was used to calculate module eigengene expression. 

**Gene_module_assignments**
List of gene module assignments for all _F graminearum_ genes (ID - RRES v5) and all wheat (_Triticum aestivum_) genes (IDs = IWGSC Refseq v2.1 and v1.1 provided) in all modules.
